## Bikeshare Project

### Description
The project uses data provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. It compares the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.

The project looks at:
1. Popular times of travel
    - The most common month, day and hour
2. Popular station and trips
    - The most common start station, end station and combination of stations
3. Trip duration
    - The total and average travel time
4. User info
    - The volume of users by user type and gender
    - The earliest, most recent and most common birth year
